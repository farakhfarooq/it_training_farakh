# Assignment 8 - Machine Learning Tasks  

## Overview  
This assignment includes multiple machine learning tasks focusing on regression and classification using datasets from Kaggle and online sources. Each task requires data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and troubleshooting errors.  

## Tasks  

### 1. Sales Forecasting for a Retail Store  
**Objective:** Predict sales using multiple features such as ad budget, discount rate, season, and store traffic.  

#### Steps:  
1. Download `retail_sales.csv` from Kaggle or Google.  
2. Install required dependencies (e.g., `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`).  
3. Run the provided Python script in PyCharm or Colab.  
4. Identify and fix any errors.  
5. Execute the script again and display the output.

### 2. Email Spam Detection using SVM  
**Objective:** Classify emails as spam or ham using Support Vector Machines (SVM).  

#### Steps:  
1. Download `sms-spam-collection.csv` from Kaggle or Google.  
2. Install dependencies (e.g., `pandas`, `sklearn`, `nltk`).  
3. Execute the script and resolve any errors.  
4. Run the script again and display the results.

### 3. Customer Churn Prediction using SVM  
**Objective:** Predict whether a customer will churn using a dataset with categorical and numerical features.  

#### Steps:  
1. Download `churn.csv` from Kaggle or Google.  
2. Install required dependencies.  
3. Run the script, identify and fix any issues.  
4. Re-run the script and present the output.

### 4. Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions  
**Objective:** Identify fraudulent transactions using Support Vector Machines (SVM).  

#### Steps:  
1. Install necessary libraries (`pandas`, `sklearn`).  
2. Compile and run the script.  
3. Print and analyze the output.

## Requirements  
Ensure the following dependencies are installed:  
```sh
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib nltk
```

## Notes  
- Use **PyCharm** if Google Colab does not function correctly.  
- Resolve any errors and ensure proper execution before submission.
